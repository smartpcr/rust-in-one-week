    # This job requires a self-hosted Windows Server runner with Failover Clustering
    #
    # Prerequisites for the self-hosted runner:
    # 1. Windows Server 2019 or 2022
    # 2. Failover Clustering feature installed:
    #    Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools
    # 3. Node must be part of a failover cluster or have access to one
    # 4. Runner service account must have cluster admin privileges
    # 5. Label the runner with: self-hosted, windows, cluster
    #
    # To set up a self-hosted runner:
    # 1. Go to repository Settings > Actions > Runners
    # 2. Click "New self-hosted runner"
    # 3. Follow instructions for Windows
    # 4. Add labels: self-hosted, windows, cluster
