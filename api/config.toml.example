# Node Agent Configuration
#
# Copy this file to config.toml and modify as needed.
# The API will look for config.toml in:
#   - Same directory as the executable (for Windows service)
#   - Current working directory (for console mode)

[server]
# Host address to bind to
# Use "0.0.0.0" to listen on all interfaces
# Use "127.0.0.1" to only accept local connections
host = "0.0.0.0"

# Port to listen on
port = 6001

[logging]
# Log level filter
# Examples:
#   "api=debug,tower_http=debug" - Debug logging for API and HTTP layer
#   "api=info,tower_http=info"   - Info level (recommended for production)
#   "debug"                       - Debug logging for all modules
#   "trace"                       - Verbose trace logging
level = "api=info,tower_http=info"

[service]
# Windows service name (used for service registration)
name = "nodeagent"

# Display name shown in Windows Services console
display_name = "Node Agent"

# Service description
description = "REST API for Windows Failover Cluster and Hyper-V management"

# Installation directory for the service

install_path = "C:\\Program Files\\azurestack\\nodeagent"
